we are building js enabled calendar app (pure css/html/js no backend)
for vacation optimization (I will explain it in details later)

let's start with canvas
on top there are options and filters:
- year (def=current)
- country (default Germany), cast to de (country code, you may try to use some public api 
    or just download a table in json and hardwire it)
- optional, city code (default Berlin, BE)
- number of days of vacation (default 20)
- how many days should be in row (default 0)
- checkbox "count weekends" (default off)
- dark/light mode switch


below filters we have a canvas with full calendar
3 rows with 4 cells each -- each cell is a month
a month itself is a table, with 7 columns (Monday - Sunday) and up to 6(?) rows for calendar weeks

draw evething and highlight the weekends as different color (orange?)
take colors for dark mode from example.html
invent some similar scheme for 

make bottom line with copyright anmd links and html meta tags (including social previews) 
from example.html (change them accordignly) (I will provide logo and favicon later)

//

I'd like you to make it more contrast in both modes
I am talking about the weekends/holydays highlightings

Now use these two APIs to check actual holydays (update parameters accordignly)
https://openholidaysapi.org/PublicHolidays?countryIsoCode=DE&validFrom=2026-01-01&validTo=2026-12-31&languageIsoCode=DE&subdivisionCode=DE-BE
https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays/2026/de

first one should be more precise, so it there is some mismatch (something in the second but not in the first)  -- we need warnings about it

//

now add the editor mode -- I can click on working day to swap it between normal/vacation days -- 
make and update a counter of used vacation days
make sure I can't use more than selected vacation days in the top controls

# also, please, make checkbox background black, now it's white in dark mode and it's so ugly

Now the tricky part.
We want to optimize vacation using some greedy scheme
we need two control buttons -- clear vacation days and run optimizer -- both in top control panel

Rules for optimization:
- we are not going to use vacation in past (so analyze only days from now 
  (or even better add a starting date in options in top line, default to today))
- we want to have as many continious (max length) sequences of day offs as possible by using minimal number of vacation days
- we start with the shortest gaps between holydays and weekends, so we fill them
- stop then all the gaps left in the future (starting from the closest monday) are 5 days or then we are out of days
# feel free to propose other interesting ideas if you have any

//

I like stats you made, but things like Free blocks (2+ days) and others -- 
they consider usual weekends making the stats non-informative

change title to Vacation Cheater
add export mode -- save PNG to clipboard (or open in a new tab); we want there to see only calendar + legend + title
